	<div class='title'>About the project</div>
	<p>
		For three years,  BloomBoard used Tableau (a third-party tool) to create reports for educatorsâ€™ end-of-year evaluation scores,  a core offering of all of our big contracts.  This solution &mdash; external to our application &mdash; created a disjointed, opaque, and inconveniently slow experience for our users.  For our company, each custom report required too many resources.  We needed to convert this manual data extraction and calculation into a scalable customer-facing product that still met compliance requirements. 
 	</p>
	<div class='title'>My role</div>
	<p>
		 I worked with a product manager to identify requirements, then served as the sole designer for the full set of tools: a workflow dashboard, an interactive worksheet, and an aggregated data report.  
 	</p>
 	<div class="title">Results</div>
 	<p>
 		The new tools allowed our company to transition 69,000 users from Tableau to our own end-of-year scoring product.

<h2> Mapping user and technical requirements </h2>

<p> The new toolset needed to meet a diverse set of  state and district requirements, but the company had little development time to devote to the project. Acknowledging that time constraints would prevent us from building a perfectly reusable system, I worked with the product manager to identify the core pieces to optimize.  Our team's solution was reusable mix-and-match front end components served by custom back-end scripts specific to each state.   I created a high-level requirements map for the company to understand the solution,  and to serve as a guide throughout the development process. </p>

<h2>Concept validation: prototypes &amp; remote user testing </h2>

<p> In conjunction with an engineer and data specialist, I developed clickable design prototypes for remote user testing of the new flow.  We focused our research on obtaining feedback on our two primary goals: ensuring the evaluator task flow was crystal clear, and making transparent the derivation of the final score.   As a result of user testing, we were able to confirm that a dedicated end-of-year progress dashboard made the task set clearer.  We  were also able to  simplify the evaluator dashboard quite a bit,  allowing the user to maintain focus on the outstanding tasks. </p>

<h2>Mix-and-match front end components to create a single location for inputs </h2>

<p> The keystone of the project was the worksheet, which displays the various components that comprise each educator's final score.  Based on ran analysis of state and district calculation formulas, I identified common tasks evaluators needed to complete in order to generate scores &mdash; what we called &ldquo;input components.&rdquo; The result was a design for reusable front-end components that, in various permutations, allowed us to create  one single end-of-year worksheet for each educator. </p>
